# Go

- Open-source programming language designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
- Statically typed ( means variable types are explicitly declared ) but also has some dynamically typed language features
- Compiled language ( source code gets translated into machine code before execution )
- Support for Cross Compilation
- Functional programming language
- Built with Concurrency in mind
- Not a truly object-oriented but has the concept of *interfaces*
- No classes
- No immutable variables
- No implicit conversions
- No Exceptions
- Not suited for realtime software ( due to garbage collection and automatic memory management )
- Has a minimalistic approach

# Need for Go

- efficient and fast compilation, fast execution, and ease of programming.
- Network communication, concurrency, and parallelization support
- Fast building speed
- Efficient memory management
