# Go
* developed in 2007 and open sourced in 2009

## Motivation behind creating Go
* Infrastructure evolved significantly – multi-core processors, cloud environments, and large-scale computation clusters became common.
* Needed to support scalable, distributed systems with dynamic workloads.
* Existing languages couldn’t fully exploit concurrency – often handling only one task at a time.
* Challenges in multithreading include:
  - multiple users editing the same document
  - multiple users booking at the same time
  - effective concurrency handling
* While languages like Java and C++ support concurrency on multi-core systems, their code tends to be complex.
* Go was designed for multi-core concurrency with simplicity in mind.
* Concurrency in Go is lightweight, efficient, and easy to use.

## Main use case of Go

* For high-performance applications
* Running on large-scale, distributed systems

## Key Characteristics

- **Simple, readable syntax** like dynamically typed languages (e.g., Python)
- **Efficiency and safety** of statically typed, lower-level languages (e.g., C++)
- Designed for **server-side use**: microservices, web apps, and database services
- Powers modern infrastructure tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, etc.
- **Minimalist syntax**, easy to learn and write
- **Resource efficient** and performant
- **Fast build, startup, and runtime**
- **Compiles quickly into a single static binary**
